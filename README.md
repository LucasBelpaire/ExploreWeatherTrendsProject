# ExploreWeatherTrendsProject

The first project of Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree. I used python (NumPy, Matplotlib) to process the .csv files I extracted from the database using SQL. 

# Summary

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.
